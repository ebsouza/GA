## **Genetic Algorithms**

Genetic Algorithms(GA) are a very popular class of Evolutionary Algorithms. They have become popular due their use in solving hard combinatorial optimization problems. Above there are a basic Genetic Algorithm template:

```
Choose an initial population of chromosomes
WHILE termination condition not satisfied DO
	REPEAT
		IF crossover condition satisfied THEN
			select parent chromosomes
			choose crossover parameters
			perform crossover
		IF mutation condition satisfied THEN
			choose mutation points
			perform mutation
			evaluate fitness of offspring
	UNTIL sufficient offspring created
select new population
END WHILE
```


## **About this project**

This is a implementation of a algorithm that I developed to solve a radiotherapy optimization problem in my master thesis. So this is a Genetic Algorithm for a specific problem, but I think it is useful to share this code because another researchers can adapt this to solve their problems.

My intention is share a code that everybody can read without difficult. A basic knowledge in arrays, functions and loop/conditional structures is enough to understand this code.

I hope this code can help you to solve your problem.
